# Neural Network Multi-class for MNIST Digit recognition
The MNIST database is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for
training various image processing systems. The database is also widely used for training and
testing in the field of machine learning.
You have to make a multiclass neural network classifier that classifies each image as
corresponding digit
Study - 
1) Effects of varying Learning rate (Eta) 
2) Effects of varying Lambda (regularization parameter) 
3) Effects of varying number of neurons in hidden layer 
4) Effects of varying number of hidden layers 
5) Effects of varying activation function (sigmoid vs tanh)
